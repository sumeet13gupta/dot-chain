##Creating Blocks :
Timestamps in miliseconds
lastHash - the hash of the data block efore it
hash -  based on its own data
the data to store



##The Genesis block:
it serves the purpose of creating the origfin for the block-chain
why is it useful? : If someone adds a new block to the chain, it contains the hash information of its previous block i.e. the Genesis block.


##Mine blocks:
based on the old blocks we can create new blocks



Block hashes and SHA-256 :
The hash is generated from the timestamp, lastHash, ad stored Data.   (256bits = 32 bytes == 32 characters)
One-way hash - from direction of data to hashes
useful for block validation.
